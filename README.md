### Good Codewars and Stack Overflow answers to common coding tasks
> Often we solve a coding challenge or come across an answer on Stack Overflow, we learn the solution but it doesn't always stick. This is to remember those solutions better and to serve as a point of reference for when you come across a common task in everyday coding and know that you have solved it before - Not to be used as a way to cheat on Codewars. 
_Repetition is how we learn_
